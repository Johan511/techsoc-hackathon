# Budget Splitting Application

We will be using React and ChakraUI for the frontend of this application. And for backend, we will be using postgres database and it would be deployed on Azure.

Budget splitting app can be used to keep track of our budget and maintain a record of how much money is to be received by us or paid to others. We can see how much money is owed by and to us at multiple occasions.

2. Users can create new events, add their friends who were involved in the event and the money owed by them.
